# Contributing Guide

## Branching & Forking
- Team members: **fork** the repo and create a branch named exactly your full name (e.g., `adam-pham`).
- Work **only** in your subsection inside `README.md` under *Team Member Contributions*.

## Commit Message Format
Use  
`docs: add contribution - <your-name>`

## Pull Requests
- Title: `Add contribution â€” <your-name>`
- Only edit your own named subsection in `README.md`.
- Keep commits small and focused.

## Reviews & Merging (TL)
- Verify that each PR adds clear, scoped content aligned with the project.
- Use **Squash & Merge** for a clean history.
- After all merges, TL adds the **Final Conclusion** section.
