# Team 6 – CalEnviroScreen 4.0 Environmental Justice Analysis

## Project Abstract
This project analyzes data and findings from the [CalEnviroScreen 4.0](https://oehha.ca.gov/calenviroscreen/report/calenviroscreen-40) report developed by the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA).  
The goal is to understand how environmental pollution burdens and population vulnerabilities interact across California communities.  
Our team interprets the composite indicators (pollution burden, population characteristics, and cumulative impact scores) to evaluate how environmental justice is being measured and what policy implications follow from the report.

## Team Leader (TL) Contribution — <Leader Name>
- Set up the GitHub repository and ensured that all required files (README, CONTRIBUTING, PR template) were included.
- Defined branch-naming and pull-request conventions.
- Reviewed, approved, and merged PRs from team members.
- Ensured all CalEnviroScreen 4.0 resources were cited correctly and linked for reference.

## Team Member Contributions

### <Member 1 Name>
- Summarized **Pollution Burden** indicators (ozone, PM 2.5, traffic, drinking-water contaminants, toxic releases, etc.).
- Explained how exposure metrics vary geographically.
- Discussed implications for public health.

### <Member 2 Name>
- Analyzed **Population Characteristics** metrics (socioeconomic, age, pre-existing health conditions).
- Compared disadvantaged versus affluent regions.
- Connected these indicators to vulnerability indexes.

### <Member 3 Name>
- Interpreted the **Cumulative Score Ranking** methodology used by OEHHA.
- Highlighted top-ranked census tracts and recurring geographic patterns.
- Related results to state policy decisions and equity planning.

### <Member 4 Name>
- Compiled visual summaries, charts, or maps that represent pollution and vulnerability correlations.
- Contributed insight into how CalEnviroScreen 4.0 informs California’s climate-equity programs.


## Final Conclusion 
CalEnviroScreen 4.0 reveals that environmental and social vulnerabilities are tightly coupled across California, disproportionately impacting low-income and marginalized populations.  
By combining pollution-exposure data with population metrics, OEHHA provides a data-driven tool that can guide targeted interventions and equitable resource allocation.  
Future improvements could include more real-time data integration and public dashboards for community transparency.
