# Team 6 – CalEnviroScreen 4.0 Environmental Justice Analysis

## Project Abstract
This project analyzes data and findings from the [CalEnviroScreen 4.0](https://oehha.ca.gov/calenviroscreen/report/calenviroscreen-40) report developed by the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA).  
The goal is to understand how environmental pollution burdens and population vulnerabilities interact across California communities.  
Our team interprets the composite indicators (pollution burden, population characteristics, and cumulative impact scores) to evaluate how environmental justice is being measured and what policy implications follow from the report.

## Team Leader (TL) Contribution — <Leader Name>
- Set up the GitHub repository and ensured that all required files (README, CONTRIBUTING, PR template) were included.
- Defined branch-naming and pull-request conventions.
- Reviewed, approved, and merged PRs from team members.
- Ensured all CalEnviroScreen 4.0 resources were cited correctly and linked for reference.

## Team Member Contributions

### Pablo Josey
- Summarized Pollution Burden indicators (ozone, PM 2.5, traffic, drinking-water contaminants, toxic releases, etc.).
- Explained how exposure metrics vary geographically.
- Discussed implications for public health.

### Reza Rizvi
- Analyzed **Population Characteristics** metrics (socioeconomic, age, pre-existing health conditions).
- Compared disadvantaged versus affluent regions.
- Connected these indicators to vulnerability indexes.

### Mohammed Almutairi
- Conducted an in-depth analysis of the Cumulative Impact Score and Ranking Methodology outlined in the CalEnviroScreen 4.0 framework.

- Evaluated how OEHHA integrates pollution burden and population vulnerability metrics to produce the overall cumulative score.

- Identified and interpreted the top-ranked census tracts with the highest environmental risk, emphasizing recurring patterns in regions most affected by pollution.

- Linked the data findings to California’s environmental justice and equity policies, explaining how cumulative rankings inform state-level decision-making and resource prioritization.

- Suggested ways to enhance equity analysis by incorporating temporal trends and cross-sectoral policy data for a more comprehensive assessment in future versions.

### Dinh Nguyen
- Compiled visual summaries, charts, or maps that represent pollution and vulnerability correlations.
- Contributed insight into how CalEnviroScreen 4.0 informs California’s climate-equity programs.


## Final Conclusion 
CalEnviroScreen 4.0 reveals that environmental and social vulnerabilities are tightly coupled across California, disproportionately impacting low-income and marginalized populations.  
By combining pollution-exposure data with population metrics, OEHHA provides a data-driven tool that can guide targeted interventions and equitable resource allocation.  
Future improvements could include more real-time data integration and public dashboards for community transparency.
